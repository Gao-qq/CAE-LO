The work based on this method is currently ranked 13th in [KITTI](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_odometry.php) named as "CAE-LO". And our paper is avialable on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.01354). 


Now, only the evaluation data and some demos are published. The source code will be here until our paper is accepted.
Generated interest points and features for sequence 00 and 01 can be found in [GoogleDrive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MATZrnTgBXeKmaIyC-x5dRHrZ6hX9Hl0).
